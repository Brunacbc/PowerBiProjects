# PowerBiProject
Analyzed survey data related to job titles, salaries, work-life balance, programming languages, breaking into data, and happiness with salary.

Created visualizations such as Treemaps, Doughnut charts, and stacked bar chart to communicate the findings and insights effectively.

Explored the country of survey takers, average salary by job title, happiness with work-life balance, favorite programming language, difficulty in breaking into data, and happiness with salary.

Count and average of survey takers were also considered in the analysis.

Key findings included the positive correlation between work-life balance and job satisfaction, Python being the most popular programming language, and the perception of moderate difficulty in breaking into the data field.
